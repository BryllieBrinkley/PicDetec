# Inception v3 Image Recognition

Welcome to my PicDetect project! This repository contains code for an image recognition application powered by the Inception v3 convolutional neural network architecture. With this application, you can upload images captured directly from your phone and receive accurate predictions about the content within them.

## Features

- **Powerful Recognition**: Utilizes the advanced capabilities of Inception v3 to accurately identify objects, scenes, and patterns within images.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for uploading images and viewing recognition results.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Performs image recognition in real-time, delivering swift and precise predictions.


## Technologies Used 

- **Swift**: This app is written in Xcode using the Swift programming language
- **CoreML**: used to integrate machine learning model
- **Inception V3**: used for image analysis and object detection

## Installation

To run this project, make sure you have Xcode on your machine and follow these steps:

1. Begin by cloning the repository onto your local machine.
2. Launch Xcode and open the project file. Ensure that an iPhone device is connected to your machine. Click the "play" button located in the Xcode toolbar.
3. Upon successful execution, grant access to the camera when prompted by clicking on the "camera icon."
4. Take a picture using the camera and select "Use photo" when prompted.
5. After selecting the photo, the top middle of the page will display the result with the most confident prediction from the Inception v3 model.

Please note: The output may not always be 100% accurate. Various factors can influence the model's prediction of the object in the selected photo.
